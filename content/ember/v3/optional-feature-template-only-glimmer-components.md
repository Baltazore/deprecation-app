Setting the `template-only-glimmer-components` optional feature to `false` has been
deprecated. You must set this feature to `true`, enabling the template-only
Glimmer components. For more details on this optional feature, including the
changes in behavior enabling it causes and how you can enable it, see the
[optional features section](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/configuring-ember/optional-features/#toc_template-only-glimmer-components)
of the Ember guides. You can also run `npx @ember/octanify` to set this feature
to the correct value.
